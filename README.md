This repository contains configuration files for testing and deploying **Splunk Connect for Syslog (SC4S)** and **Splunk Universal Forwarder**.

## 🧪 Lab Scope

The goal is to simulate and troubleshoot real-world logging scenarios by:

- Running SC4S via Docker
- Connecting to Splunk HEC (Dev instance)
- Testing Cisco IOS log ingestion (IPv4 + IPv6)
- Exploring DNS hostname resolution via SC4S
- Comparing direct ingestion vs forwarder-based ingestion
